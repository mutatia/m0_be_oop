# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

  It felt good. A little frustrating at times, but it was very fun.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

  Great!

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

  I don't think I need anything that I don't already have.
